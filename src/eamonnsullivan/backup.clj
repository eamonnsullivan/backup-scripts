(ns eamonnsullivan.backup
  "A wrapper around rsync that manages multiple backups of multiple
  hosts. After each backup, it creates a hard link (effectively
  creating a snapshot of the current difference since the previous
  backup) and checks the free space available on the storage
  device. If free space is less than double the size of the most
  recent backup, we remove older backups.

  At the start of a new month, we begin a fresh backup. This is to
  avoid any potential issues with bad sectors.

  Usage: <backup-from> <name-of-backup>

  Examples: backup.clj root@thinkpad.local:/home thinkpad
            backup.clj sullie09@mc-s105910.local:~ workmac"
